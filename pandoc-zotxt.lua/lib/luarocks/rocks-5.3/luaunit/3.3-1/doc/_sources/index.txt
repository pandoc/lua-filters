Welcome to LuaUnit's documentation!

Introduction
************

LuaUnit is a popular unit-testing framework for Lua, with an interface typical
of xUnit libraries (Python unittest, Junit, NUnit, ...). It supports 
several output formats (Text, TAP, JUnit, ...) to be used directly or work with Continuous Integration platforms
(Jenkins, Hudson, ...).

For simplicity, LuaUnit is contained into a single-file and has no external dependency. To start using it, 
just add the file *luaunit.lua* to your project. A `LuaRocks package`_  is also available.

.. _LuaRocks package: https://luarocks.org/modules/bluebird75/luaunit

Tutorial and reference documentation is available on `Read-the-docs`_ .

.. _Read-the-docs: http://luaunit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

LuaUnit also provides some dedicated support to scientific computing. See the section `Scientific computing and LuaUnit`_

LuaUnit may also be used as an assertion library. In that case, you will call the assertion functions, which generate errors
when the assertion fails. The error includes a detailed analysis of the failed assertion, like when executing a test suite.

LuaUnit provides another generic usage function: :func:`prettystr` which converts any value to a nicely
formatted string. It supports in particular tables, nested table and even recursive tables.


More details
************

LuaUnit provides a wide range of assertions and goes into great efforts to provide the most useful output. For example
since version 3.3 , comparing lists will provide a detailed difference analysis:

.. code-block:: lua

    -- lua test code. Can you spot the difference ?
    function TestListCompare:test1()
        local A = { 121221, 122211, 121221, 122211, 121221, 122212, 121212, 122112, 122121, 121212, 122121 } 
        local B = { 121221, 122211, 121221, 122211, 121221, 122212, 121212, 122112, 121221, 121212, 122121 }
        lu.assertEquals( A, B )
    end

    $ lua test_some_lists_comparison.lua

    TestListCompare.test1 ... FAIL
    test/some_lists_comparisons.lua:22: expected: 

    List difference analysis:
    * lists A (actual) and B (expected) have the same size
    * lists A and B start differing at index 9
    * lists A and B are equal again from index 10
    * Common parts:
      = A[1], B[1]: 121221
      = A[2], B[2]: 122211
      = A[3], B[3]: 121221
      = A[4], B[4]: 122211
      = A[5], B[5]: 121221
      = A[6], B[6]: 122212
      = A[7], B[7]: 121212
      = A[8], B[8]: 122112
    * Differing parts:
      - A[9]: 122121
      + B[9]: 121221
    * Common parts at the end of the lists
      = A[10], B[10]: 121212
      = A[11], B[11]: 122121


The command-line options provide a flexible interface to select tests by name or patterns, control output
format, set verbosity and more. See `Using the command-line`_ .

LuaUnit is very well tested: code coverage is 99.5% . The test suite is run on every version of Lua (Lua 5.1 to 5.3, LuaJIT 2.0 and 2.1 beta)
and on many OS (Windows Seven, Windows Server 2012, MacOs X and Ubuntu). You can check the continuous build results on `Travis-CI`_ and `AppVeyor`_ .

.. _Travis-CI: https://travis-ci.org/bluebird75/luaunit
.. _AppVeyor: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/bluebird75/luaunit/history

LuaUnit is maintained on GitHub: https://github.com/bluebird75/luaunit . We gladly accept feature requests and even better Pull Requests.

LuaUnit is released under the BSD license.


Installation
============

LuaUnit is packed into a single-file. To make start using it, just add the file to your project. 

Several installation methods are available.

LuaRocks
--------

LuaUnit v3.3 is available as a `LuaRocks package`_ .

.. _LuaRocks package: https://luarocks.org/modules/bluebird75/luaunit

GitHub
------

The simplest way to install LuaUnit is to fetch the GitHub version:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:bluebird75/luaunit.git

Then copy the file luaunit.lua into your project or the Lua libs directory.

The version in development on GitHub is always stable and can be used safely.

On Linux, you can also install it into your Lua directories

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo python doit.py install

If that fail, edit the function *install()* in the file *doit.py* to adjust
the Lua version and installation directory. It uses, by default, Linux paths that depend on the version.


Upgrade note
================

**Important note when upgrading to version 3.1 and above** : there is a break of backward compatibility in version 3.1, assertions functions are no longer exported directly to the global namespace. See :ref:`luaunit-global-asserts` on how to adjust or restore previous behavior.

Getting started with LuaUnit
****************************

This section will guide you through a step by step usage of *LuaUnit* . The full source code
of the example below is available in the : :ref:`source-code-example` or in the file *my_test_suite.lua* 
in the doc directory.

Setting up your test script
===========================

To get started, create your file *my_test_suite.lua* . 

The script should import LuaUnit::

    lu = require('luaunit')

The last line executes your script with LuaUnit and exit with the
proper error code::

    os.exit( lu.LuaUnit.run() )

Now, run your file with::

    lua my_test_suite.lua

It prints something like::

    Ran 0 tests in 0.000 seconds, 0 successes, 0 failures
    OK

Now, your testing framework is in place, you can start writing tests.

Writing tests
=============

LuaUnit scans all variables that start with *test* or *Test*. 
If they are functions, or if they are tables that contain
functions that start with *test* or *Test*, they are run as part of the test suite.

So just write a function whose name starts with test. Inside test functions, use the assertions functions provided by LuaUnit, such
as :func:`assertEquals`.

Let's see that in practice.

Suppose you want to test the following add function::

    function add(v1,v2)
        -- add positive numbers
        -- return 0 if any of the numbers are 0
        -- error if any of the two numbers are negative
        if v1 < 0 or v2 < 0 then
            error('Can only add positive or null numbers, received '..v1..' and '..v2)
        end
        if v1 == 0 or v2 == 0 then
            return 0
        end
        return v1+v2
    end

You write the following tests::

    function testAddPositive()
        lu.assertEquals(add(1,1),2)
    end

    function testAddZero()
        lu.assertEquals(add(1,0),0)
        lu.assertEquals(add(0,5),0)
        lu.assertEquals(add(0,0),0)
    end


:func:`assertEquals` is the most commonly used assertion function. It 
verifies that both argument are equals, in the order actual value, expected value.

Rerun your test script (``-v`` is to activate a more verbose output)::

    $ lua my_test_suite.lua -v

It now prints::

    Started on 02/19/17 22:15:53
        TestAdd.testAddPositive ... Ok
        TestAdd.testAddZero ... Ok
    =========================================================
    Ran 2 tests in 0.003 seconds, 2 successes, 0 failures
    OK

You always have:

* the date at which the test suite was started
* the group to which the function belongs (usually, the name of the function table, and *<TestFunctions>* for all direct test functions)
* the name of the function being executed
* a report at the end, with number of executed test, number of non selected tests if any, number of failures, number of errors (if any) and duration.

The difference between failures and errors are:

* luaunit assertion functions generate failures
* any unexpected error during execution generates an error
* failures or errors during setup() or teardown() always generate errors


If we continue with our example, we also want to test that when the function receives negative numbers, it generates an error. Use
:func:`assertError` or even better, :func:`assertErrorMsgContains` to also validate the content
of the error message. There are other types or error checking functions, see `Error assertions`_ . Here
we use :func:`assertErrorMsgContains` . First argument is the expected message, then the function to call
and the optional arguments::

    function testAddError()
        lu.assertErrorMsgContains('Can only add positive or null numbers, received 2 and -3', add, 2, -3)
    end

Now, suppose we also have the following function to test::

    function adder(v)
        -- return a function that adds v to its argument using add
        function closure( x ) return x+v end
        return closure
    end

We want to test the type of the value returned by adder and its behavior. LuaUnit
provides assertion for type testing (see `Type assertions`_ ). In this case, we use
:func:`assertIsFunction`::

    function testAdder()
        f = adder(3)
        lu.assertIsFunction( f )
        lu.assertEquals( f(2), 5 )
    end

Grouping tests, setup/teardown functionality
=====================================================

When the number of tests starts to grow, you usually organise them
into separate groups. You can do that with LuaUnit by putting them
inside a table (whose name must start with *Test* or *test* ).

For example, assume we have a second function to test::

    function div(v1,v2)
        -- divide positive numbers
        -- return 0 if any of the numbers are 0
        -- error if any of the two numbers are negative
        if v1 < 0 or v2 < 0 then
            error('Can only divide positive or null numbers, received '..v1..' and '..v2)
        end
        if v1 == 0 or v2 == 0 then
            return 0
        end
        return v1/v2
    end

We move the tests related to the function add into their own table::

    TestAdd = {}
        function TestAdd:testAddPositive()
            lu.assertEquals(add(1,1),2)
        end

        function TestAdd:testAddZero()
            lu.assertEquals(add(1,0),0)
            lu.assertEquals(add(0,5),0)
            lu.assertEquals(add(0,0),0)
        end

        function TestAdd:testAddError()
            lu.assertErrorMsgContains('Can only add positive or null numbers, received 2 and -3', add, 2, -3)
        end

        function TestAdd:testAdder()
            f = adder(3)
            lu.assertIsFunction( f )
            lu.assertEquals( f(2), 5 )
        end
    -- end of table TestAdd

Then we create a second set of tests for div::

    TestDiv = {}
        function TestDiv:testDivPositive()
            lu.assertEquals(div(4,2),2)
        end

        function TestDiv:testDivZero()
            lu.assertEquals(div(4,0),0)
            lu.assertEquals(div(0,5),0)
            lu.assertEquals(div(0,0),0)
        end

        function TestDiv:testDivError()
            lu.assertErrorMsgContains('Can only divide positive or null numbers, received 2 and -3', div, 2, -3)
        end
    -- end of table TestDiv

Execution of the test suite now looks like this::

    Started on 02/19/17 22:15:53
        TestAdd.testAddError ... Ok
        TestAdd.testAddPositive ... Ok
        TestAdd.testAddZero ... Ok
        TestAdd.testAdder ... Ok
        TestDiv.testDivError ... Ok
        TestDiv.testDivPositive ... Ok
        TestDiv.testDivZero ... Ok
    =========================================================
    Ran 7 tests in 0.006 seconds, 7 successes, 0 failures
    OK


When tests are defined in tables, you can optionally define two special
functions, *setUp()* and *tearDown()*, which will be executed
respectively before and after every test.

These function may be used to create specific resources for the
test being executed and cleanup the test environment.

For a practical example, imagine that we have a *log()* function
that writes strings to a log file on disk. The file is created
upon first usage of the function, and the filename is defined
by calling the function *initLog()*.

The tests for these functions would take advantage of the *setup/teardown*
functionality to prepare a log filename shared
by all tests, make sure that all tests start with a non existing
log file name, and delete the log filename after every test::

    TestLogger = {}
        function TestLogger:setUp()
            -- define the fname to use for logging
            self.fname = 'mytmplog.log'
            -- make sure the file does not already exists
            os.remove(self.fname)
        end

        function TestLogger:testLoggerCreatesFile()
            initLog(self.fname)
            log('toto')
            -- make sure that our log file was created
            f = io.open(self.fname, 'r')
            lu.assertNotNil( f )
            f:close()
        end

        function TestLogger:tearDown()
            -- cleanup our log file after all tests
            os.remove(self.fname)
        end

.. Note::

    *Errors generated during execution of setUp() or tearDown()
    functions are considered test failures.*


.. Note::

    *For compatibility with luaunit v2 and other lua unit-test frameworks, 
    setUp() and tearDown() may also be named setup(), SetUp(), Setup() and teardown(), TearDown(), Teardown().*


Using the command-line
======================

You can control the LuaUnit execution from the command-line:

**Output format**

Choose the test output format with ``-o`` or ``--output``. Available formats are:

* text: the default output format
* nil: no output at all
* tap: TAP format
* junit: output junit xml

Example of non-verbose text format::

    $ lua doc/my_test_suite.lua
    .......
    Ran 7 tests in 0.003 seconds, 7 successes, 0 failures
    OK


Example of TAP format::

    $ lua doc/my_test_suite.lua -o TAP
    1..7
    # Started on 02/19/17 22:15:53
    # Starting class: TestAdd
    ok     1        TestAdd.testAddError
    ok     2        TestAdd.testAddPositive
    ok     3        TestAdd.testAddZero
    ok     4        TestAdd.testAdder
    # Starting class: TestDiv
    ok     5        TestDiv.testDivError
    ok     6        TestDiv.testDivPositive
    ok     7        TestDiv.testDivZero
    # Ran 7 tests in 0.007 seconds, 7 successes, 0 failures

For a more detailed overview of all formats and their verbosity see the section `Output formats`_ .


**List of tests to run**

You can list some test names on the command-line to run only those tests.
The name must be the exact match of either the test table, the test function or the test table
and the test method. The option may be repeated.

Example::

    -- Run all TestAdd table tests and one test of TestDiv table.
    $ lua doc/my_test_suite.lua TestAdd TestDiv.testDivError -v
    Started on 02/19/17 22:15:53
        TestAdd.testAddError ... Ok
        TestAdd.testAddPositive ... Ok
        TestAdd.testAddZero ... Ok
        TestAdd.testAdder ... Ok
        TestDiv.testDivError ... Ok
    =========================================================
    Ran 5 tests in 0.003 seconds, 5 successes, 0 failures
    OK

**Including / excluding tests**

The most flexible approach for selecting tests to use the include and exclude functionality.
With ``--pattern`` or ``-p``, you can provide a lua pattern and only the tests that contain
the pattern will actually be run.

Example::

    -- Run all tests of zero testing and error testing
    -- by using the magic character .
    $ lua my_test_suite.lua -v -p Err.r -p Z.ro

For our test suite, it gives the following output::

    Started on 02/19/17 22:15:53
        TestAdd.testAddError ... Ok
        TestAdd.testAddZero ... Ok
        TestDiv.testDivError ... Ok
        TestDiv.testDivZero ... Ok
    =========================================================
    Ran 4 tests in 0.003 seconds, 4 successes, 0 failures, 3 non-selected
    OK

The number of tests ignored by the selection is printed, along
with the test result. The pattern can be any lua pattern. Be sure to exclude all magic
characters with % (like -+?*) and protect your pattern from the shell
interpretation by putting it in quotes.

You can also exclude tests that match some patterns:

Example::

    -- Run all tests except zero testing and except error testing
    $ lua my_test_suite.lua -v -x Error -x Zero

For our test suite, it gives the following output::

    Started on 02/19/17 22:29:45
        TestAdd.testAddPositive ... Ok
        TestAdd.testAdder ... Ok
        TestDiv.testDivPositive ... Ok
    =========================================================
    Ran 3 tests in 0.003 seconds, 3 successes, 0 failures, 4 non-selected
    OK

You can also combine test selection and test exclusion. See `Flexible test selection`_

Conclusion
==========

You now know enough of LuaUnit to start writing your test suite. Check
the reference documentation for a complete list of
assertions, command-line options and specific behavior.


Reference documentation
***********************

.. _luaunit-global-asserts:

Enabling global or module-level functions
=========================================

Versions of LuaUnit before version 3.1 would export all assertions functions to the global namespace. A typical
lua test file would look like this:

.. code-block:: lua

    require('luaunit')

    TestToto = {} --class

        function TestToto:test1_withFailure()
            local a = 1
            assertEquals( a , 1 )
            -- will fail
            assertEquals( a , 2 )
        end

    [...]

However, this is an obsolete practice in Lua. It is now recommended to keep all functions inside the module. Starting
from version 3.1 LuaUnit follows this practice and the code should be adapted to look like this:

.. code-block:: lua

    -- the imported module must be stored
    lu = require('luaunit')

    TestToto = {} --class

        function TestToto:test1_withFailure()
            local a = 1
            lu.assertEquals( a , 1 )
            -- will fail
            lu.assertEquals( a , 2 )
        end

    [...]

If you prefer the old way, LuaUnit can continue to export assertions functions if you set the following
global variable **prior** to importing LuaUnit:

.. code-block:: lua

    -- this works
    EXPORT_ASSERT_TO_GLOBALS = true
    require('luaunit')

    TestToto = {} --class

        function TestToto:test1_withFailure()
            local a = 1
            assertEquals( a , 1 )
            -- will fail
            assertEquals( a , 2 )
        end

    [...]


LuaUnit.run() function
======================

**Return value**

Run your test suite with the following line::

    os.exit(lu.LauaUnit.run())

The *run()* function returns the number of failures of the test suite. This is
good for an exit code, 0 meaning success.


**Arguments**

If no arguments are supplied, it parses the command-line arguments of the script
and interpret them. If arguments are supplied to the function, they are parsed
instead of the command-line. It uses the same syntax.

Example::

    -- execute tests matching the 'withXY' pattern
    os.exit(lu.LuaUnit.run('--pattern', 'withXY'))


**Choice of tests**

If test names were supplied, only those
tests are executed. When test names are supplied as arguments, they don't have
to start with *test*, they are run anyway.

If no test names were supplied, a general test collection process starts
under the following rules:

* all variable starting with *test* or *Test* are scanned. 
* if the variable is a function it is collected for testing
* if the variable is a table:

    * all keys starting with *test* or *Test* are collected (provided that they are functions)
    * keys with name *setUp* and *tearDown* are also collected

If one or more pattern were supplied, the test are then filtered according the
pattern(s). Only the test that match the pattern(s) are actually executed.


**setup and teardown**

The function *setUp()* is executed before each test if it exists in the table. 
The function *tearDown()* is executed after every test if it exists in the table.

.. Note::
    *tearDown()* is always executed if it exists, even if there was a failure in the test or in the *setUp()* function.
    Failures in *setUp()* or *tearDown()* are considered as a general test failures.


LuaUnit.runSuite() function
==============================

If you want to keep the flexibility of the command-line parsing, but want to force
some parameters, like the output format, you must use a slightly different syntax::

    runner = lu.LuaUnit.new()
    runner:setOutputType("tap")
    os.exit( runner:runSuite() )

*runSuite()* behaves like *run()* except that it must be started
with a LuaUnit instance as first argument, and it will use the LuaUnit
instance settings.
 

Command-line options
====================

Usage: lua <your_test_suite.lua> [options] [testname1 [testname2] ...]

**Test names**

When no test names are supplied, all tests are collected. 

The syntax for supplying test names can be either: name of the function, name of the table
or [name of the table].[name of the function]. Only the supplied tests will be executed.

Selecting tests with --pattern and --exclude is usually more flexible. See `Flexible test selection`_

**Options**

--output, -o FORMAT    Set output format to FORMAT. Possible values: text, tap, junit, nil . See `Output formats`_
--name, -n FILENAME    For junit format only, mandatory name of xml file. Ignored for other formats.
--pattern, -p PATTERN  Execute all test names matching the Lua PATTERN. May be repeated to include severals patterns. See `Flexible test selection`_
--exclude, -x PATTERN  Exclude all test names matching the Lua PATTERN. May be repeated to exclude severals patterns. See `Flexible test selection`_
--repeat, -r NUM       Repeat all tests NUM times, e.g. to trigger the JIT. See `Other options`_
--shuffle, -s          Shuffle tests before running them. See `Other options`_
--error, -e            Stop on first error. See `Other options`_
--failure, -f          Stop on first failure or error. See `Other options`_
--verbose, -v          Increase verbosity
--quiet, -q            Set verbosity to minimum
--help, -h             Print help
--version              Version information of LuaUnit

Output formats
------------------

Choose the output format with the syntax ``-o FORMAT`` or ``--output FORMAT``.

Formats available:

* ``text``: the default output format of LuaUnit
* ``tap``: output compatible with the `Test Anything Protocol`_ 
* ``junit``: output compatible with the *JUnit XML* format (used by many CI 
  platforms). The XML is written to the file provided with the ``--name`` or ``-n`` option.
* ``nil``: no output at all

.. _Test Anything Protocol: http://testanything.org/

To demonstrate the different output formats, we will take the example of the `Getting started with LuaUnit`_
section and add the following two failing cases:

.. code-block:: lua

    TestWithFailures = {}
        -- two failing tests
        
        function TestWithFailures:testFail1()
            local a="toto"
            local b="titi"
            lu.assertEquals( a, b ) --oops, two values are not equal
        end

        function TestWithFailures:testFail2()
            local a=1
            local b='toto'
            local c = a + b --oops, can not add string and numbers
            return c
        end


**Text format**

By default, LuaUnit uses the output format TEXT, with minimum verbosity::

    $ lua my_test_suite.lua
    .......FE
    Failed tests:
    -------------
    1) TestWithFailures.testFail1
    doc\my_test_suite_with_failures.lua:79: expected: "titi"
    actual: "toto"
    stack traceback:
            doc\my_test_suite_with_failures.lua:79: in function 'TestWithFailures.testFail1'

    2) TestWithFailures.testFail2
    doc\my_test_suite_with_failures.lua:85: attempt to perform arithmetic on local 'b' (a string value)
    stack traceback:
            [C]: in function 'xpcall'

    Ran 9 tests in 0.001 seconds, 7 successes, 1 failure, 1 error

This format is heavily inspired by python unit-test library. One character is printed
for every test executed, a dot for a successful test, a **F** for a test with failure and
a **E** for a test with an error.

At the end of the test suite execution, the details of the failures or errors are given, with an
informative message and a full stack trace.

The last line sums up the number of test executed, successful, failed, in error and not selected if any.
When all tests are successful, a line with just OK is added::

    $ lua doc\my_test_suite.lua
    .......
    Ran 7 tests in 0.002 seconds, 7 successes, 0 failures
    OK


The text format is also available as a more verbose version, by adding the ``--verbose`` flag::

    $ lua doc\my_test_suite_with_failures.lua --verbose
    Started on 02/20/17 21:47:21
        TestAdd.testAddError ... Ok
        TestAdd.testAddPositive ... Ok
        TestAdd.testAddZero ... Ok
        TestAdd.testAdder ... Ok
        TestDiv.testDivError ... Ok
        TestDiv.testDivPositive ... Ok
        TestDiv.testDivZero ... Ok
        TestWithFailures.testFail1 ... FAIL
    doc\my_test_suite_with_failures.lua:79: expected: "titi"
    actual: "toto"
        TestWithFailures.testFail2 ... ERROR
    doc\my_test_suite_with_failures.lua:85: attempt to perform arithmetic on local 'b' (a string value)
    =========================================================
    Failed tests:
    -------------
    1) TestWithFailures.testFail1
    doc\my_test_suite_with_failures.lua:79: expected: "titi"
    actual: "toto"
    stack traceback:
            doc\my_test_suite_with_failures.lua:79: in function 'TestWithFailures.testFail1'

    2) TestWithFailures.testFail2
    doc\my_test_suite_with_failures.lua:85: attempt to perform arithmetic on local 'b' (a string value)
    stack traceback:
            [C]: in function 'xpcall'

    Ran 9 tests in 0.008 seconds, 7 successes, 1 failure, 1 error

In this format, you get:

* a first line with date-time at which the test was started
* one line per test executed
* the test line is ended by **Ok**, **FAIL**, or **ERROR** in case the test is not successful
* a summary of the failed tests with all details, like in the compact version.

This format is usually interesting if some tests print debug output, to match the output to the test.

**JUNIT format**

The Junit XML format was introduced by the `Java testing framework JUnit`_ and has been then used by many continuous
integration platform as an interoperability format between test suites and the platform.

.. _Java testing framework JUnit: http://junit.org/junit4/ 

To output in the JUnit XML format, you use the format junit with ``--output junit`` and specify the XML filename with ``--name <filename>`` . On
the standard output, LuaUnit will print information about the test progress in a simple format.

Let's see with a simple example::

    $ lua my_test_suite_with_failures.lua -o junit -n toto.xml
    # XML output to toto.xml
    # Started on 02/24/17 09:54:59
    # Starting class: TestAdd
    # Starting test: TestAdd.testAddError
    # Starting test: TestAdd.testAddPositive
    # Starting test: TestAdd.testAddZero
    # Starting test: TestAdd.testAdder
    # Starting class: TestDiv
    # Starting test: TestDiv.testDivError
    # Starting test: TestDiv.testDivPositive
    # Starting test: TestDiv.testDivZero
    # Starting class: TestWithFailures
    # Starting test: TestWithFailures.testFail1
    # Failure: doc/my_test_suite_with_failures.lua:79: expected: "titi"
    # actual: "toto"
    # Starting test: TestWithFailures.testFail2
    # Error: doc/my_test_suite_with_failures.lua:85: attempt to perform arithmetic on local 'b' (a string value)
    # Ran 9 tests in 0.007 seconds, 7 successes, 1 failure, 1 error

On the standard output, you will see the date-time, the name of the XML file, one line for each test started, a summary 
of the failure or errors when they occurs and the usual one line summary of the test execution: number of tests run, successful, failed,
in error and number of non selected tests if any.

The XML file generated by this execution is the following::

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
    <testsuites>
        <testsuite name="LuaUnit" id="00001" package="" hostname="localhost" tests="9" timestamp="2017-02-24T09:54:59" time="0.007" errors="1" failures="1">

            </testcase>
            <testcase classname="TestWithFailures" name="TestWithFailures.testFail2" time="0.000">

        <system-out/>
        <system-err/>
        </testsuite>
    </testsuites>

As you can see, the XML file is quite rich in terms of information. The verbosity level has no effect on junit output, all verbosity give the same output.

Slight inconsistencies exist in the exact XML format in the different continuous integration suites. LuaUnit provides a compatible output which
is validated against `Jenkins/Hudson schema`_ 
and `Ant/Maven schema`_ . If you ever find an problem in the XML formats, please report a bug to us, more testing is always welcome.

.. _Ant/Maven schema:  https://github.com/bluebird75/luaunit/blob/LUAUNIT_V3_2_1/junitxml/junit-apache-ant.xsd 
.. _Jenkins/Hudson schema: https://github.com/bluebird75/luaunit/blob/LUAUNIT_V3_2_1/junitxml/junit-jenkins.xsd  

**TAP format**

The `TAP format`_ for test results has been around since 1988. LuaUnit produces TAP reports compatible with version 12 of
the specification.

.. _`TAP format`: https://testanything.org/

Example with minimal verbosiy::

    $ lua my_test_suite_with_failures.lua -o tap --quiet
    1..9
    # Started on 02/24/17 22:09:31
    # Starting class: TestAdd
    ok     1        TestAdd.testAddError
    ok     2        TestAdd.testAddPositive
    ok     3        TestAdd.testAddZero
    ok     4        TestAdd.testAdder
    # Starting class: TestDiv
    ok     5        TestDiv.testDivError
    ok     6        TestDiv.testDivPositive
    ok     7        TestDiv.testDivZero
    # Starting class: TestWithFailures
    not ok 8        TestWithFailures.testFail1
    not ok 9        TestWithFailures.testFail2
    # Ran 9 tests in 0.003 seconds, 7 successes, 1 failure, 1 error

With minimal verbosity, you have one line for each test run, with the status of the test, and one comment line
when starting the test suite, when starting a new class or when finishing the test.


Example with default verbosiy::

    $ lua my_test_suite_with_failures.lua -o tap
    1..9
    # Started on 02/24/17 22:09:31
    # Starting class: TestAdd
    ok     1        TestAdd.testAddError
    ok     2        TestAdd.testAddPositive
    ok     3        TestAdd.testAddZero
    ok     4        TestAdd.testAdder
    # Starting class: TestDiv
    ok     5        TestDiv.testDivError
    ok     6        TestDiv.testDivPositive
    ok     7        TestDiv.testDivZero
    # Starting class: TestWithFailures
    not ok 8        TestWithFailures.testFail1
        doc/my_test_suite_with_failures.lua:79: expected: "titi"

    not ok 9        TestWithFailures.testFail2
        doc/my_test_suite_with_failures.lua:85: attempt to perform arithmetic on local 'b' (a string value)
    # Ran 9 tests in 0.005 seconds, 7 successes, 1 failure, 1 error

In the default mode, the failure or error message is displayed in the failing test diagnostic part.

Example with full verbosiy::

    $ lua my_test_suite_with_failures.lua -o tap --verbose
    1..9
    # Started on 02/24/17 22:09:31
    # Starting class: TestAdd
    ok     1        TestAdd.testAddError

    ok     3        TestAdd.testAddZero
    ok     4        TestAdd.testAdder
    # Starting class: TestDiv

    ok     6        TestDiv.testDivPositive
    ok     7        TestDiv.testDivZero
    # Starting class: TestWithFailures
    not ok 8        TestWithFailures.testFail1
        doc/my_test_suite_with_failures.lua:79: expected: "titi"
        actual: "toto"
        stack traceback:
            doc/my_test_suite_with_failures.lua:79: in function 'TestWithFailures.testFail1'
    not ok 9        TestWithFailures.testFail2
        doc/my_test_suite_with_failures.lua:85: attempt to perform arithmetic on local 'b' (a string value)
        stack traceback:
            [C]: in function 'xpcall'
    # Ran 9 tests in 0.007 seconds, 7 successes, 1 failure, 1 error

With maximum verbosity, the stack trace is also displayed in the test diagnostic.

**NIL format**

With the nil format output, absolutely nothing is displayed while running the tests. Only the
exit code of the command can tell whether the test was successful or not::

    $ lua my_test_suite_with_failures.lua -o nil --verbose
    $

This mode is used by LuaUnit for its internal validation.



Other options
--------------

**Stopping on first error or failure**

If ``--failure`` or ``-f`` is passed as an option, LuaUnit will stop on the first failure or error and display the test results.

If ``--error`` or ``-e`` is passed as an option, LuaUnit will stop on the first error (but continue on failures).

**Randomize test order**

If ``--shuffle`` or ``-s`` is passed as an option, LuaUnit will execute tests in random order. The randomisation works on all test functions
and methods. As a consequence test methods of a given class may be splitted into multiple location, generating several test class creation and destruction.

**Repeat test**

When using luajit, the just-in-time compiler will kick in only after a given function has been executed a sufficient number of times. To make sure
that the JIT is not introducing any bug, LuaUnit provides a way to repeat a test may times, with ``--repeat`` or ``-r`` followed by a number.

Flexible test selection
-------------------------

LuaUnit provides very flexible way to select which tests to execute. We will illustrate this with several examples.

In the examples, we use a test suite composed of the following test funcions::

    -- class: TestAdd
    TestAdd.testAddError
    TestAdd.testAddPositive
    TestAdd.testAddZero
    TestAdd.testAdder

    -- class: TestDiv
    TestDiv.testDivError
    TestDiv.testDivPositive
    TestDiv.testDivZero


With ``--pattern`` or ``-p``, you can provide a lua pattern and only the tests that contain
the pattern will actually be run.

Example::

    -- Run all tests of zero testing and error testing
    -- by using the magic character .
    $ lua mytest_suite.lua -v -p Err.r -p Z.ro
    Started on 02/19/17 22:29:45
        TestAdd.testAddError ... Ok
        TestAdd.testAddZero ... Ok
        TestDiv.testDivError ... Ok
        TestDiv.testDivZero ... Ok
    =========================================================
    Ran 4 tests in 0.004 seconds, 4 successes, 0 failures, 3 non-selected
    OK

The number of tests ignored by the selection is printed, along
with the test result. The tests *TestAdd.testAdder testAdd.testPositive and
testDiv.testDivPositive* have been correctly ignored.

The pattern can be any lua pattern. Be sure to exclude all magic
characters with % (like ``-+?*``) and protect your pattern from the shell
interpretation by putting it in quotes.

With ``--exclude`` or ``-x``, you can provide a lua pattern of tests which should
be excluded from execution.

Example::

    -- Run all tests except zero testing and except error testing
    $ lua mytest_suite.lua -v -x Error -x Zero
    Started on 02/19/17 22:29:45
        TestAdd.testAddPositive ... Ok
        TestAdd.testAdder ... Ok
        TestDiv.testDivPositive ... Ok
    =========================================================
    Ran 3 tests in 0.003 seconds, 3 successes, 0 failures, 4 non-selected
    OK

You can also combine test selection and test exclusion. The rules are the following:

* if the first argument encountered is a inclusion pattern, the list of tests start empty
* if the first argument encountered is an exclusion pattern, the list of tests start with all tests of the suite
* each subsequent inclusion pattern will add new tests to the list
* each subsequent exclusion pattern will remove test from the list
* the final list is the list of tests executed

In pure logic term, inclusion is the equivalent of ``or match(pattern)`` and exclusion is ``and not match(pattern)`` .

Let's look at some practical examples::

Assertions functions
=====================
We will now list all assertion functions. For every functions, the failure
message tries to be as informative as possible, by displaying the expectation and value that caused the failure. It
relies on the :func:`prettystr` for printing nicely formatted values.

All function accept an optional extra message which if provided, is printed along with the failure message.

.. Note:: see :ref:`table-printing` and :ref:`comparing-table-keys-table` for more dealing with recursive tables and tables containing keys of type table.


Equality assertions
----------------------
All equality assertions functions take two arguments, in the order 
*actual value* then *expected value*. Some people are more familiar
with the order *expected value* then *actual value*. It is possible to configure
LuaUnit to use the opposite order for all equality assertions, by setting up a module
variable:

.. code-block:: lua

    lu.ORDER_ACTUAL_EXPECTED=false

The order only matters for the message that is displayed in case of failures. It does
not influence the test itself.


.. function:: assertEquals(actual, expected [, extra_msg] )

    **Alias**: *assert_equals()*

    Assert that two values are equal. 

    For tables, the comparison is a deep comparison :

    * number of elements must be the same
    * tables must contain the same keys
    * each key must contain the same values. The values
      are also compared recursively with deep comparison.

    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.

    LuaUnit provides other table-related assertions, see :ref:`assert-table` .


.. function:: assertNotEquals(actual, expected [, extra_msg])

    **Alias**: *assert_not_equals()*

    Assert that two values are different. The assertion
    fails if the two values are identical. Like the previous function, it uses table deep comparison.

    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.

Value assertions
----------------------

LuaUnit contains several flavours of true/false assertions, to be used in different contexts.
Usually, when asserting for *true* or *false*, you want strict assertions (*nil* should not 
assert to *false*); *assertTrue()* and *assertFalse()* are the functions for this purpose. In some cases though,
you want Lua coercion rules to apply (e.g. value *1* or string *"hello"* yields *true*) and the right functions to use
are *assertEvalToTrue()* and *assertEvalToFalse()*. Finally, you have the *assertNotTrue()* and *assertNotFalse()* to verify
that a value is anything but the boolean *true* or *false*.

The below table sums it up:

============  ============  ===================  ================  =============  ===================  ===============
**True assertion family**                                            **False assertion family**

.. function:: assertEvalToTrue(value [, extra_msg])

    **Alias**: *assert_eval_to_true()*

    Assert that a given value evals to ``true``. Lua coercion rules are applied
    so that values like ``0``, ``""``, ``1.17`` **succeed** in this assertion. If provided, 
    extra_msg is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.

    See :func:`assertTrue` for a strict assertion to boolean ``true``.

.. function:: assertEvalToFalse(value [, extra_msg])

    **Alias**: *assert_eval_to_false()*

    Assert that a given value eval to ``false``. Lua coercion rules are applied
    so that ``nil`` and ``false``  **succeed** in this assertion. If provided, extra_msg 
    is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.

    See :func:`assertFalse` for a strict assertion to boolean ``false``.
    
.. function:: assertTrue(value [, extra_msg])

    **Alias**: *assert_true()*

    Assert that a given value is strictly ``true``. Lua coercion rules do not apply
    so that values like ``0``, ``""``, ``1.17`` **fail** in this assertion. If provided, 
    extra_msg is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.

    See :func:`assertEvalToTrue` for an assertion to ``true`` where Lua coercion rules apply.
    
.. function:: assertFalse(value [, extra_msg])

    **Alias**: *assert_false()*

    Assert that a given value is strictly ``false``. Lua coercion rules do not apply
    so that ``nil`` **fails** in this assertion. If provided, *extra_msg* is a string 
    which will be printed along with the failure message.

    See :func:`assertEvalToFalse` for an assertion to ``false`` where Lua coertion fules apply.
    
.. function:: assertNil(value [, extra_msg])

    **Aliases**: *assert_nil()*, *assertIsNil()*, *assert_is_nil()*

    Assert that a given value is *nil* . If provided, *extra_msg* is 
    a string which will be printed along with the failure message.
    
.. function:: assertNotNil(value [, extra_msg])

    **Aliases**: *assert_not_nil()*, *assertNotIsNil()*, *assert_not_is_nil()*

    Assert that a given value is not *nil* . Lua coercion rules are applied
    so that values like ``0``, ``""``, ``false`` all validate the assertion.
    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.

.. function:: assertIs(actual, expected [, extra_msg])

    **Alias**: *assert_is()*

    Assert that two variables are identical. For string, numbers, boolean and for nil, 
    this gives the same result as :func:`assertEquals` . For the other types, identity
    means that the two variables refer to the same object. 
    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.

    **Example :**

.. code-block:: lua

        s1='toto'
        s2='to'..'to'
        t1={1,2}
        t2={1,2}
        v1=nil
        v2=false

        lu.assertIs(s1,s1) -- ok
        lu.assertIs(s1,s2) -- ok

    refer to the same value. If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.

    See :func:`assertIs` for more details.
    

String assertions
--------------------------

Assertions related to string and patterns.

.. function:: assertStrContains( str, sub [, isPattern [, extra_msg ]] )

    **Alias**: *assert_str_contains()*

    Assert that the string *str* contains the substring or pattern *sub*. 
    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.

    By default, substring is searched in the string. If *isPattern*
    is provided and is true, *sub* is treated as a pattern which
    is searched inside the string *str* .
    

.. function:: assertStrIContains( str, sub [, extra_msg] )

    **Alias**: *assert_str_icontains()*

    Assert that the string *str* contains the given substring *sub*, irrespective of the case. 
    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.

    Note that unlike :func:`assertStrcontains`, you can not search for a pattern.



.. function:: assertNotStrContains( str, sub, [isPattern [, extra_msg]] )

    **Alias**: *assert_not_str_contains()*

    Assert that the string *str* does not contain the substring or pattern *sub*.
    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.

    By default, the substring is searched in the string. If *isPattern*
    is provided and is true, *sub* is treated as a pattern which
    is searched inside the string *str* .
    

.. function:: assertNotStrIContains( str, sub [, extra_msg] )

    **Alias**: *assert_not_str_icontains()*

    Assert that the string *str* does not contain the substring *sub*, irrespective of the case. 
    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.

    Note that unlike :func:`assertNotStrcontains`, you can not search for a pattern.


.. function:: assertStrMatches( str, pattern [, start [, final [, extra_msg ]]]  )

    **Alias**: *assert_str_matches()*

    Assert that the string *str* matches the full pattern *pattern*.

    If *start* and *final* are not provided or are *nil*, the pattern must match the full string, from start to end. The
    function allows to specify the expected start and end position of the pattern in the string. If provided, 
    *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.
    

Error assertions
--------------------------
Error related assertions, to verify error generation and error messages.

.. function:: assertError( func, ...)

    **Alias**: *assert_error()*

    Assert that calling functions *func* with the arguments yields an error. If the
    function does not yield an error, the assertion fails.

    Note that the error message itself is not checked, which means that this function
    does not distinguish between the legitimate error that you expect and another error
    that might be triggered by mistake.

    The next functions provide a better approach to error testing, by checking
    explicitly the error message content.

.. Note::

    When testing LuaUnit, switching from *assertError()* to  *assertErrorMsgEquals()*
    revealed quite a few bugs!
    
.. function:: assertErrorMsgEquals( expectedMsg, func, ... )

    **Alias**: *assert_error_msg_equals()*

    Assert that calling function *func* will generate exactly the given error message. If the
    function does not yield an error, or if the error message is not identical, the assertion fails.

    Be careful when using this function that error messages usually contain the file name and
    line number information of where the error was generated. This is usually inconvenient. To 
    ignore the filename and line number information, you can either use a pattern with :func:`assertErrorMsgMatches`
    or simply check for the message content with :func:`assertErrorMsgContains` .
    
.. function:: assertErrorMsgContains( partialMsg, func, ... )

    **Alias**: *assert_error_msg_contains()*

    Assert that calling function *func* will generate an error message containing *partialMsg* . If the
    function does not yield an error, or if the expected message is not contained in the error message, the 
    assertion fails.
    
.. function:: assertErrorMsgMatches( expectedPattern, func, ... )

    **Alias**: *assert_error_msg_matches()*

    Assert that calling function *func* will generate an error message matching *expectedPattern* . If the
    function does not yield an error, or if the error message does not match the provided patternm the
    assertion fails.

    Note that matching is done from the start to the end of the error message. Be sure to escape magic all magic
    characters with ``%`` (like ``-+.?*``) .
    

Type assertions
--------------------------

    The following functions all perform type checking on their argument. If the
    received value is not of the right type, the failure message will contain
    the expected type, the received type and the received value to help you
    identify better the problem.

.. function:: assertIsNumber(value [, extra_msg])

    **Aliases**: *assertNumber()*, *assert_is_number()*, *assert_number()*

    Assert that the argument is a number (integer or float).
    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.
    
.. function:: assertIsString(value [, extra_msg])

    **Aliases**: *assertString()*, *assert_is_string()*, *assert_string()*

    Assert that the argument is a string.
    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.
    
.. function:: assertIsTable(value [, extra_msg])

    **Aliases**: *assertTable()*, *assert_is_table()*, *assert_table()*

    Assert that the argument is a table.
    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.
    
.. function:: assertIsBoolean(value [, extra_msg])

    **Aliases**: *assertBoolean()*, *assert_is_boolean()*, *assert_boolean()*

    Assert that the argument is a boolean.
    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.
    
.. function:: assertIsNil(value [, extra_msg])

    **Aliases**: *assertNil()*, *assert_is_nil()*, *assert_nil()*

    Assert that the argument is nil.
    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.
    
.. function:: assertIsFunction(value [, extra_msg])

    **Aliases**: *assertFunction()*, *assert_is_function()*, *assert_function()*

    Assert that the argument is a function.
    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.
    
.. function:: assertIsUserdata(value [, extra_msg])

    **Aliases**: *assertUserdata()*, *assert_is_userdata()*, *assert_userdata()*

    Assert that the argument is a userdata.
    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.
    
.. function:: assertIsCoroutine(value [, extra_msg])

    **Aliases**: *assertCoroutine()*, *assert_is_coroutine()*, *assert_coroutine()*

    Assert that the argument is a coroutine (an object with type *thread* ).
    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.
    
.. function:: assertIsThread(value [, extra_msg])

    **Aliases**: *assertIsThread()*, *assertThread()*, *assert_is_thread()*, *assert_thread()*

    Same function as :func:assertIsCoroutine . Since Lua coroutines have the type thread, it's not
    clear which name is the clearer, so we provide syntax for both names.
    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.


.. _assert-table:

Table assertions
--------------------------

.. function:: assertItemsEquals(actual, expected [, extra_msg])

    **Alias**: *assert_items_equals()*

    Assert that two tables contain the same items, irrespective of their keys.
    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.

    This function is practical for example if you want to compare two lists but
    where items are not in the same order:

.. code-block:: lua

        lu.assertItemsEquals( {1,2,3}, {3,2,1} ) -- assertion succeeds

..

    The comparison is not recursive on the items: if any of the items are tables,
    they are compared using table equality (like as in :func:`assertEquals` ), where
    the key matters.


.. code-block:: lua

        lu.assertItemsEquals( {1,{2,3},4}, {4,{3,2,},1} ) -- assertion fails because {2,3} ~= {3,2}



Ending test 
---------------------

LuaUnit allows to force test ending, either positevely or negatively, with the following functions.

.. function:: fail( message )

    Stops the ongoing test and mark it as failed with the given message.


.. function:: failIf( cond, message )

    If the condition *cond* evaluates to *true*, stops the ongoing test and mark it as failed with the given message.
    Else, continue the test execution normally.

.. function:: success()

    Stops the ongoing test and mark it as successful.

.. function:: successIf( cond )

    If the condition *cond* evaluates to *true*, stops the ongoing test and mark it as successful.
    Else, continue the test execution normally.


Scientific computing and LuaUnit
--------------------------------

LuaUnit is used by the CERN for the MAD-NG program, the forefront of computational physics in the field of particle accelerator design and simulation (See MAD_). Thank to the feedback of a scientific computing developer, LuaUnit has been enhanced with some facilities for scientific applications (see all assertions functions below).

.. _MAD: http://mad.web.cern.ch/mad/

The floating point library used by Lua is the one provided by the C compiler which built Lua. It is usually compliant with IEEE-754_ . As such, 
it can yields results such as *plus infinity*, *minus infinity* or *Not a Number* (NaN). The precision of any calculation performed in Lua is 
related to the smallest representable floating point value (typically called *EPS*): 2^-52 for 64 bits floats (type double in the C language) and 2^-23 for 32 bits float 
(type float in C). 

.. _IEEE-754: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754 

.. Note :: Lua may be compiled with numbers represented either as 32 bits floats or 64 bits double (as defined by the macro LUA_FLOAT_TYPE in luaconf.h ). LuaUnit has been validated in both these configurations and in particuluar, the epsilon value *EPS* is adjusted accordingly.

For more information about performing calculations on computers, please read the reference paper `What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic`_

.. _What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html 

If your calculation shall be portable to multiple OS or compilers, you may get different calculation errors depending on the OS/compiler. It is therefore important to verify them on every target.


.. _MinusZero: 

.. Note:: 
    If you need to deal with value *minus zero*, be very careful because Lua versions are inconsistent on how they treat the syntax *-0* : it creates either
    a *plus zero* or a *minus zero* . Multiplying or dividing *0* by *-1* also yields inconsistent results. The reliable way to create the *-0* 
    value is : minusZero = -1 / (1/0)


.. _EPS:

**EPS** *constant*

The machine epsilon, to be used with :func:`assertAlmostEquals` .

This is either:

* 2^-52 or ~2.22E-16 (with lua number defined as double)
* 2^-23 or ~1.19E-07 (with lua number defined as float)

    verification is done by dividing by the provided number and verifying that it yields
    *infinity* . If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.

        pi_div_6_deg_calculated = math.deg(math.pi/6)
        pi_div_6_deg_expected = 30

        -- convert pi/3 radian to 60 degree

        -- check absolute error: it is not constant
        print( (pi_div_6_deg_expected - pi_div_6_deg_calculated) / lu.EPS ) -- prints: 16
        print( (pi_div_3_deg_expected - pi_div_3_deg_calculated) / lu.EPS ) -- prints: 32

        -- Better use relative error:
        print( ( (pi_div_6_deg_expected - pi_div_6_deg_calculated) / pi_div_6_deg_expected) / lu.EPS ) -- prints: 0.53333
        print( ( (pi_div_3_deg_expected - pi_div_3_deg_calculated) / pi_div_3_deg_expected) / lu.EPS ) -- prints: 0.53333

        -- relative error is constant. Assertion can take the form of:
        assertAlmostEquals( (pi_div_6_deg_expected - pi_div_6_deg_calculated) / pi_div_6_deg_expected, lu.EPS )
        assertAlmostEquals( (pi_div_3_deg_expected - pi_div_3_deg_calculated) / pi_div_3_deg_expected, lu.EPS )


Pretty printing
----------------

.. function:: prettystr( value )

    Converts *value* to a nicely formatted string, whatever the type of the value.
    It supports in particular tables, nested table and even recursive tables.

    You can use it in your code to replace calls to *tostring()* .

**Example of prettystr()**
    
.. code-block:: lua

        > lu = require('luaunit')
        > t1 = {1,2,3}
        > t1['toto'] = 'titi'
        > t1.f = function () end
        > t1.fa = (1 == 0)
        > t1.tr = (1 == 1)
        > print( lu.prettystr(t1) )
        {1, 2, 3, f=function: 00635d68, fa=false, toto="titi", tr=true}

Contributing
=============
You may contribute to LuaUnit by reporting bugs or wishes, or by contributing code directly with a pull request.

Some issues on GitHub are marked with label *enhancement*. Feel also free to pick up such tasks and implement them.

Changes should be proposed as *Pull Requests* on GitHub.

Thank to our continous integration setup with Travis-Ci and AppVeyor, all unit-tests and functional tests are run on Linux, Windows and MacOs, with all versions of Lua. So
any *Pull Request* will show immediatly if anything is going unexpected.


Unit-tests
-------------------
All proposed changes should pass all unit-tests and if needed, add more unit-tests to cover the bug or the new functionality. Usage is pretty simple:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ lua run_unit_tests.lua
    ................................................................................
    ...............................
    Ran 111 tests in 0.120 seconds
    OK


Functional tests
-------------------
Functional tests also exist to validate LuaUnit. Their management is slightly more complicated. 

The main goal of functional tests is to validate that LuaUnit output has not been altered. Since LuaUnit supports some standard compliant output (TAP, junitxml), this is very important (and it has been broken in the past)

Functional tests perform the following actions:

* Run the 2 suites: example_with_luaunit.lua, test_with_err_fail_pass.lua (with various options to have successe, failure and/or errors)
* Run every suite with all output format, all verbosity
* Validate the XML output with jenkins/hudson and junit schema
* Compare the results with the previous output ( archived in test/ref ), with some tricks to make the comparison possible :

    * adjustment of the file separator to use the same output on Windows and Unix
    * date and test duration is zeroed so that it does not impact the comparison
    * adjust the stack trace format which has changed between Lua 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3

* Run some legacy suites or tricky output to manage and verify output: test_with_xml.lua, , compat_luaunit_v2x.lua, legacy_example_with_luaunit.lua


For functional tests to run, *diff* must be available on the command line. *xmllint* is needed to perform the xml validation but
this step is skipped if *xmllint* can not be found.

When functional tests work well, it looks like this:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ lua run_functional_tests.lua
    ...............
    Ran 15 tests in 9.676 seconds
    OK


When functional test fail, a diff of the comparison between the reference output and the current output is displayed (it can be quite 
long). The list of faulty files is summed-up at the end.

Modifying reference files for functional tests
-----------------------------------------------
The script run_functional_tests.lua supports a --update option, with an optional argument.

* *--update* without argument **overwrites all reference output** with the current output. Use only if you know what you are doing, this is usually a very bad idea!

* The following argument overwrite a specific subset of reference files, select the one that fits your change:

    *  TestXml: XML output of test_with_xml
    *  ExampleXml: XML output of example_with_luaunit
    *  ExampleTap: TAP output of example_with_luaunit
    *  ExampleText: text output of example_with_luaunit
    *  ExampleNil: nil output of example_with_luaunit
    *  ErrFailPassText: text output of test_with_err_fail_pass
    *  ErrFailPassTap: TAP output of test_with_err_fail_pass
    *  ErrFailPassXml: XML output of test_with_err_fail_pass
    *  StopOnError: errFailPassTextStopOnError-1.txt, -2.txt, -3.txt, -4.txt


For example to record a change in the test_with_err_fail_pass output

.. code-block:: shell

    $ lua run_functional_tests.lua --update ErrFailPassXml ErrFailPassTap ErrFailPassText

    >>>>>>> Generating test/ref/errFailPassXmlDefault.txt
    >>>>>>> Generating test/ref/errFailPassXmlDefault-success.txt

    >>>>>>> Generating test/ref/errFailPassTextVerbose-success.txt
    >>>>>>> Generating test/ref/errFailPassTextVerbose-failures.txt
    $

You can then commit the new files into git.

.. Note :: how to commit updated reference outputs

    When committing those changes into git, please use if possible an
    intelligent git committing tool to commit only the interesting changes.
    With SourceTree for example, in case of XML changes, I can select only the
    lines relevant to the change and avoid committing all the updates to test
    duration and test datestamp.



Typical failures for functional tests
---------------------------------------

Functional tests may start failing when:

1. Increasing LuaUnit version
2. Improving or breaking LuaUnit output

This a good place to start looking if you see failures occuring.

Annexes
********

.. _table-printing:

Annex A: More on table printing
================================

When asserting tables equality, by default, the table content is printed in case of failures. LuaUnit tries to print
tables in a readable format. It is 
possible to always display the table id along with the content, by setting a module parameter PRINT_TABLE_REF_IN_ERROR_MSG . This
helps identifying tables:

.. code-block:: lua

    local lu = require('luaunit')

    local t1 = {1,2,3}
    -- normally, t1 is dispalyed as: "{1,2,3}"

    -- if setting this:
    lu.PRINT_TABLE_REF_IN_ERROR_MSG = true

    -- display of table t1 becomes: "<table: 0x29ab56> {1,2,3}"


.. Note :: table loops

    When displaying table content, it is possible to encounter loops, if for example two table references eachother. In such
    cases, LuaUnit display the full table content once, along with the table id, and displays only the table id for the looping
    reference.

**Example:** displaying a table with reference loop

.. code-block:: lua

    local t1 = {}
    local t2 = {}
    t1.t2 = t2
    t1.a = {1,2,3}
    t2.t1 = t1

    -- when displaying table t1:
    --   table t1 inside t2 is only displayed by its id because t1 is already being displayed
    --   table t2 is displayed along with its id because it is part of a loop.
    -- t1: "<table: 0x29ab56> { a={1,2,3}, t2=<table: 0x27ab23> {t1=<table: 0x29ab56>} }"


.. _comparing-table-keys-table:

Annex B: Comparing tables with keys of type table
==================================================

    If provided, *extra_msg* is a string which will be printed along with the failure message.


This is a very uncommon scenario but there are a few programs out there which use tables as keys for other tables. LuaUnit has been adjusted to deal intelligently with this scenario.

A small code block is worth a thousand pictures :

.. code-block:: lua

    local lu = require('luaunit')

    -- let's define two tables
    t1 = { 1, 2 }
    t2 = { 1, 2 }
    lu.assertEquals( t1, t2 ) -- succeeds

    -- let's define three tables, with the two above tables as keys
    t3 = { t1='a' }
    t4 = { t2='a' }
    t5 = { t2='a' }

There are two ways to treat comparison of tables t3 and t4:

**Method 1: table keys are compared by content**

* t3 contain one key: t1
* t4 contain one key: t2, which has exactly the same content as t1
* the two keys compare equally with assertEquals, so assertEquals( t3, t4 ) succeeds

**Method 2: table keys are compared by reference**

* t3 contain one key: t1
* t4 contain one key: t2, which is not the same table as t1, its reference is different
* the two keys are different because t1 is a different object than t2 so assertEquals( t3, t4 ) fails

Whether method 1 or method 2 is more appropriate is up for debate.

LuaUnit has been adjusted to support both scenarios, with the config variable: *TABLE_EQUALS_KEYBYCONTENT*

* TABLE_EQUALS_KEYBYCONTENT = true (default): method 1 - table keys compared by content
* TABLE_EQUALS_KEYBYCONTENT = false: method 2 - table keys compared by reference

In any case, assertEquals( t4, t5 ) always succeeds.

To adjust the config, change it into the luaunit table before running any tests:


.. code-block:: lua

    local lu = require('luaunit')

    -- define all your tests
    -- ...

    lu.TABLE_EQUALS_KEYBYCONTENT = false
    -- run your tests:
    os.exit( lu.LuaUnit.run() )
