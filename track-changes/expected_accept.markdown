Track changes in LaTeX and HTML
===============================

A **simple** comment from me.

This is a text with an *exciting* insertion.

This is/was a text with a deletion.

Here is the text to be moved.

Here is a comment with nested changes.

Here is a multi-line paragraph containing some text and a long deletion wrapping over two lines.

This is a new paragraph.

And so is this.

One more.

A *header* with a comment {#a-header-width-a-notecomment}
=========================

Some unmodified text ...

\newpage

... continued from previous page just to test page headers in supporting formats (LaTeX, DOCX, etc.).
