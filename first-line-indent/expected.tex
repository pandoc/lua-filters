First paragraph. Usually without first-line indent. Lorem ipsum dolor
sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec tincidunt lacinia metus id
ullamcorper. Integer eget magna quis ipsum lobortis dignissim.

This paragraph should start with a first-line indent. But after this
quote:

\begin{quote}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
\end{quote}

\noindent The paragraph continues, so there should not be a first-line
indent.

The quote below ends a paragraph:

\begin{quote}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
\end{quote}

\indent This paragraph, then, is genuinely a new paragraph and starts
with a first-line indent.

\hypertarget{further-tests}{%
\section{Further tests}\label{further-tests}}

After a heading (in English typographic style) the paragraph does not
have a first-line indent.

In the couple couple of paragraphs that follow the quotes below, we have
manually specified \texttt{\textbackslash{}noindent} and
\texttt{\textbackslash{}indent} respectively. This is to check that the
filter doesn't add its own commands to those.

\begin{quote}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
\end{quote}

\noindent Manually specified no first line indent.

\indent Manually specified first line ident.

We can also check that indent is removed after lists:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A bullet
\item
  list
\end{itemize}

\noindent And after code blocks:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{local}\NormalTok{ variable }\OperatorTok{=} \StringTok{"value"}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\noindent Or horizontal rules.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\noindent Last but not least, you can fiddle with the filter options in
the document metadata and see what happens.
