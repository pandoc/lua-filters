# pandoc-quotes.lua

`pandoc-quotes.lua` is a filter for [Pandoc](https://www.pandoc.org/) that
replaces non-typographic quotation marks with typographic ones for languages
other than American English.

You can define which typographic quotation marks to replace plain ones with by
setting either a document's `quot-marks`, `quot-lang`, or `lang` metadata
field. Typically, it should 'just work'.

See the [manual page](man/pandoc-quotes.lua.md) for details.


## Installing `pandoc-quotes.lua`

You use `pandoc-quotes.lua` **at your own risk**. You have been warned.

### Requirements

You need [Pandoc](https://www.pandoc.org/) 2.0 or later.


### Installation

1. Download [pandoc-quotes.lua](https://github.com/odkr/pandoc-quotes.lua/blob/main/pandoc-quotes.lua).
2. Move `pandoc-quotes.lua` from the repository directory to the
   `filters` sub-directory of your Pandoc data directory
   (`pandoc --version` will tell you where that is).

### POSIX-compliant systems

If you have [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) or
[wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/), you can (probably)
install `pandoc-quotes.lua` by copy-pasting the
following commands into a bourne shell:

```sh
(
    set -Cefu
    NAME=pandoc-quotes.lua VERS=0.1.10
    URL="https://github.com/odkr/${NAME:?}/archive/v${VERS:?}.tar.gz"
    FILTERS="${HOME:?}/.pandoc/filters"
    mkdir -p "${FILTERS:?}"
    {
        curl -L "$URL" || ERR=$?
        [ "${ERR-0}" -eq 127 ] && wget -q -O - "$URL"
    } | tar xz
    mv "$NAME-$VERS/pandoc-quotes.lua" "$FILTERS"
)
```

You may also want to copy the manual page from the `man` directory in the
repository to wherever your operating system searches for manual pages.


## Test suite

For the test suite to work, you need a POSIX-compliant operating system,
[make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)), and
[Pandoc](https://www.pandoc.org/) 2.7.2. The test suite may or may not
work with other versions of Pandoc.

To run the test suite, just say:

```sh
    make test
```
