<p>Short appoggiaturas are by no means impracticable in pizzicato. The following passage from the Scherzo of Beethovenâ€™s C-minor Symphony is always executed very well.</p>

<p>Some of our young violinists have learned from Paganini to play rapid descending scales in pizzicato by plucking the strings with the fingers of the left hand, which rests firmly on the neck of the violin. They sometimes combine pizzicato notes (always played with the left hand) with bowed tones, even using the pizzicato as an accompaniment of a melody played by the bow. All players will doubtless become familiar with these various techniques in the course of time. Then composers will be able to take full advantage of them.</p>
