# Lua Filters

This repository collects Lua filters for pandoc.

To learn about Lua filters, see the
[documentation](http://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html).

Structure
---------

Each filter goes in its own subdirectory.  Each subdirectory contains:

- the filter itself (e.g. `wordcount.lua`)
- a `README.md` describing the use of the filter
- a `Makefile` with a `test` target to test the filter
- some data files used for the tests, which may also serve
  as examples

Requirements
------------

Filters are tested against the latest pandoc version.  There is
no guarantee that filters will work with older versions, but
many do.

Some filters depend on external programs, which must be installed
separately.  Refer to the filters' README for detailed
requirements.

Contributing
------------

PRs for new filters are welcome, provided they conform to these
guidelines. Lua code should ideally follow the Olivine Labs [Lua
style guide].
